Problem:
    • Whenever we make any changes to .ts file then we need to run tsc app.ts command to generate app.js file and see the effect on browser

Solution
    • Use watch mode
    • TS will watch for any file change
    • If changes found, TS will automatically  recompile.

Command to run
    • tsc app.ts --watch OR
    • tsc app.ts -w

Downside
    • We need to specify the individual file
