Problem:
    • How to compile .ts to .js when we have more than one file

Solution:
    • to initialize entire repo with typescript

Command to run    
    • tsc --init 
        ◦ Run this command on entire project only once
        ◦ It'll create tsconfig.json file
    • tsc
        ◦ to compile all .ts file present in your project.
        ◦ no need to specify any file now.  
    • tsc -w OR
    • tsc --watch
        ◦ to apply watch mode on all the files
