What is Typescript?
    • Typescript is a Javascript superset, it means that it is building up on JS.
    • It takes JS language and adds new features and advantages to it.
    • It makes writing JS code more easier and more powerful.
    • Disadvantage:
        ◦ TS can't be executed by JS environments like browsers.
        ◦ Environment where we can run JS, they don't support TS.
    • Why to use TS then?
        ◦ TS is a programming langugae but also a tool.
        ◦ It is a powerful compiler which we run over our code and it compiles TS code into JS code.
        ◦ It adds types.
        ◦ Helps to identify code errors at compile time rather than at runtime.

Questions:
    • How can TS add new feature if end result is regular JS?
        → TS will compile the code to JS workarounds
        → Would create a simpler sturcture rather than us writing complex logic.
